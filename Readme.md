I developed a robust Go backend with a REST API and designed a user-friendly interface using Bootstrap to create a powerful and intuitive weather application. My WeatherApp allows users to quickly access real-time weather information for any location worldwide. I integrated the Mapbox API to fetch location coordinates and the Weatherstack API to retrieve up-to-date weather data, ensuring users have access to accurate and timely information.<br>

## Key Features:<br>
- **User-Friendly Interface**: I prioritized user experience by creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface using Bootstrap. Users can easily navigate the application to access the weather data they need effortlessly.<br>
- **Location Search**: My WeatherApp enables users to search for weather information in any location globally. They can either enter a city name or provide specific coordinates to get accurate weather data.<br>
- **Real-time Weather Data**: I integrated the Weatherstack API to fetch real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. This ensures that users always have access to the latest weather conditions.<br>
- **Map Integration**: By utilizing the Mapbox API, My WeatherApp provides users with interactive maps that display the location of the specified area. This visual representation enhances the user's understanding of the weather conditions in a particular region.<br>
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: To guarantee a seamless user experience, I implemented robust error handling throughout the application. Users receive clear and informative error messages if there are issues with their requests or if the system encounters any problems.<br>
